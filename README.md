PHPVMSGEN is a FREE service to provide data for import to PHPVMS Virtual Airline Software

PHPVMSGEN was created to serve a personal idea in how to get a substantial amount of data into a virtual airline 
without spending hours and hours inputting each record one by one.                                              
Since PHPVMS has a function within the Administration section when maintaining records in that you can export or import
the data by means of CSV files, I saw the opportunity to think about using that method.                                      
As you are inputting the data into PHPVMS as a batch when importing via a CSV file , I saw that if I created the CSV
files myself then I could import them which would have saved time.                                                   
Of course creating the content for CSV files still meant a lot of time was going to be spent on that task.                    
Again some thoughts occured to me from past experiences on commercial projects and my own project with the thought
'Well what if I could create the CSV files using a database and some coding'.  

PHPVMSGEN began life that day and has been worked upon since.                                                             
Yes I could have just coded the database and the CSV files just for my own requirements but since the data is
extracted from a single database of all the information I needed not just that requirement I decided to make the 
process parameter driven so that each time it was run it would build a different set of CSV files.                        
                                                                                                                      
PHPVMSGEN is thus a FREE service to all users of PHPVMS and there is no software for you to install to get the 
benefits and data from PHPVMSGEN for your own use.

Some facts and figures that PHPVMSGEN uses -:
Due to the decreased capacity and operation of the world's airlines due to the Covid-19 crisis the schedules used 
for building flights in PHPVMSGEN are from a period just before the outbreak and are not therfore current schedules.
That being said here are the facts

AIRPORTS - details of 11,097 airports with ICAO codes.                                                                        
FLIGHTS  - details of 759,558 individual flights . Note obviosly some flights are the same but on different days of the week.                       
FLEETS   - details of 910 different aircraft types most with detailed specifications.
